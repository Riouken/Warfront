Warfront
========

An Arma 3 Mission



Warfront is my Coop mission that is based on defensive positions(Building FOBs) and protecting them,
then running missions out of the FOB's. It is player/vehicle/aircraft adaptable on the fly.
By that it will adjust amount of AI, the types of AI and if there are Vehicles or Aircraft being operated,
it will change the mission accordingly.

It also has a large Support element that will change depending on if there are players in that support role or it will use AI.
It also has random patrols throughout the map including AA,AT and Squad patrols.

If you call for transport, if a player is in a transport vehicle then it will call that player and assign them a task for your support.
If no player is on then it will use AI to drop you a vehicle.
If there is a player in one of the CAS vehicles when you call for CAS it will give them a task, if not then it will spawn a AI support to come and assist you.
